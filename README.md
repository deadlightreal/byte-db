# Byte DB

Welcome to **Byte DB** – a high-performance database system designed to revolutionize data storage and retrieval. The goal of Byte DB is to create a database system that maximizes speed by using a non-readable method to store data, making it faster than traditional database competitors. Byte DB will focus on the raw storage of bits and bytes, offering manual serialization that empowers developers to directly manipulate byte-level data.

## 🚀 Goal of Byte DB

The primary objective of Byte DB is to create a **high-performance database** system that optimizes speed and efficiency by avoiding traditional readable formats for data storage. By using non-readable storage mechanisms, Byte DB will provide an edge in terms of raw performance and allow for fine-grained control over how data is serialized and deserialized.

### Key Goals:
- **Raw Bit/Byte Storage:** Data will be stored as raw bits and bytes, avoiding traditional human-readable formats like JSON or text-based serialization.
- **High Performance:** Byte DB aims to be faster than existing databases by focusing on low-level, binary data storage.
- **Manual Serialization:** Users will need to manually serialize data, inserting the data as raw bytes directly. For example, instead of inserting a string, users will insert the byte representation of the string.
- **Optimized for Speed:** Byte DB’s architecture will be designed to prioritize performance with a focus on low-level data operations.

Please note that Byte DB is still under active development, and these goals are part of our roadmap for future features.
